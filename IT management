Volkswagen should treat some projects specially?
1. unfair 
2. too theoretical
3. IT was an obstacle

1. IT infrastructure projects were treated separately their long run benefits are difficult to quantify.
2. Projects not funded in the new process are comparatively less priotized for enterprise goals, so Volkswagen had better focus their insufficient fund on the more important projects.
3. Approving special treatments would encourage BU to bargin with Matulovic rather than to prioritize their objectives.
