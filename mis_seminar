The paper I discuss is Professor David Card's paper The Causal Effect of Education on Earnings, which was included in Handbook of Labor Economics in 1998. In one of Professor David Card's early work (), he was the first to analyze causal link between education and earnings by using geographic accessability of colleage as an instrument for education . Since then, plenty economists constructed various instruments to study the same topic. In the his 1998 paper, he summarized and examined most of the instruments put forward, and in this assignment I follow his analyzing framework and give my critique to some of the IV used in that stream of research.
In this work, he mainly analyzed 4 types of instrument variables adopted in previous research.
1. Geographic proximity of schools. This approach was originally proposed by David Card, in his 1994 work he argued presence of a local college lowers the costs of attending colleage and raises the perceived benefits of education among children in poor families. On whether living near the colleage has a direct effect on earning, he proposed since the geographic proximity mainly benefits poor families, so if the location really affect earning through education indirectly, then the size of effect should be larger for poor faimilies. The problem of this instument is that the residence approximity to colleage could be related to future earning. For example, the economic well being of a city drives its average wage higher, and a prefereable place to host a colleage because of sufficient budget. It's also possible that a colleage have positive externalty which attract good companies locate around it.
2. Family background information such as parents' education. This approach is proposed by Card 1995 and Conneely adn Uusitalo 1997. Their logic is based on this finding: children's schooling outcomes are greatly influenced by he characteristics of their parents' education. When parents have higher education, they are more aware of the importance of good education thus would provide their offspring better education opportunities. However, this instrument also suffer from the problem that the instrument may independently correlate with children's future earning. For example, parents with higher education are more likely to possess higher social status and could possibly provide their children better job opportunities.
3. Using twins. This approach addresses family background differences between different children by using twins for comparision. The logic is that twins share similar ability, family background and social resources. Nevertheless, if the twins do have similar abilities then there should be no differences in their education. On the other hand, if twins have different abilities, then the ability differences could affect both education and future earnings, thus making the instrument not so valid.
Taking all these possible instruments into consideration, the more convincing approach is using institutional features of school systems:
4. Institutional features of school systems. Anrist and Krueger 1991 observed compulsory schooling laws require that children born in the same calendar year typically start school at the same time. So children born ealier in the year reach the minimum shool-leaving age ealier than those who born later in the same year. The instrument used here is quarter and state of birth. Although there are people arguing that the particular time of birth decides people's constellation or incidence of mental illness, I think generally the instrument used here should have no relationship with people's earning capability except from influencing people's age of entering school.
